# Personal-Website
This is a backup of my personal website.
A website was made using html, css and java. It was a part of the exercise for the Web development subject. Content of the website could be chosen depending on the interest, so for this assignment I chose to make a "personal artist's website" to share my musical background, work and process in music production. Since the server where the website is deployed will be available for usage in the future, I am planning to turn this website into a professional portfolio website that will serve as a CV and that will contain all current and future project, ideas and scientific assays that I have written. 

The website is accessed through: https://formacio.bq.ub.edu/~u217741/
