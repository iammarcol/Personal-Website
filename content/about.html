                <p>Born in 1999, Mael (Marko Ludaic) is a Serbian singer-songwriter who combines the elements of 
                    classical music, r&b, soul and trap to create a new unique sound. His first single "Volja" was 
                    released in January and it was the title-track of his EP. Marko plays three musical instruments. 
                    He has finished music school for piano, violin and opera signing and has been producing music 
                    since 2016.</p>
