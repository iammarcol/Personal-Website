                <h1>THE BEGINNING</h1>
                <p>The idea to make the "Nocturno Red Flag" album came suddenly.
                    After I've finished the making of another album which hasn't
                    been released yet, I started experimenting with the production
                    and different vocal and sound effects. That's how most of the
                    songs have been born. I had them saved in the library, patiently
                    waiting to be released one day. I always start a songwriting 
                    process on the piano. That's the instrument I'm most
                    comfortable with, since I've been playing it since I was 7 years old.

                <h2>THE BASE OF</h2>
                <h2>THE PRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>For the main music production I got most of the inspiration
                    listening to artists like BANKS, FKA Twigs and Sevdaliza. 
                    This had been also around the time I've found out about amazing
                    070 Shake and her newest release. Since she uses quite interesting
                    effects in her music, these had a huge influence over my personal
                    music production for this particular project. Songwriting is also
                    very important in my song-making process. I choose words very carefully
                    in order to make complete stories. Every sentence is honest and raw.

                <h3>MIXING VOCALS</h3>
                <p>Besides songwriting, harmonization and mixing is my favorite part
                    of the process! I love layering, so I tend to add a lot of vocal
                    lines, especially for the ending chorus. That's when melodies have 
                    to merge perfectly and effects have to shine through. For this album
                    the most used vocal effect has been iZotope VocalSynth Pro which adds
                    interesting frequency layers on top of the base vocal line. The used
                    of this effect can be clearly depicted on the "OUTRO(mine)", the last
                    song on the album.
